title: Component Arguments
description: > 
  In Octane, arguments passed to a component are set on a new `args` property, `this.args`, instead of being set directly on the class instance, `this`.
  This avoids the possibility of overwriting methods and actions, and makes the distinction between internal class values and arguments much more clear.
